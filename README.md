## Node.js

This bot is developed using Node.js, a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows for asynchronous event-driven programming which is perfect for handling incoming and outgoing messages efficiently.

## Validation

The script includes validation mechanisms to ensure that incoming messages are properly formatted and processed according to the bot's intended functionality. This helps maintain the reliability and security of interactions with users.
